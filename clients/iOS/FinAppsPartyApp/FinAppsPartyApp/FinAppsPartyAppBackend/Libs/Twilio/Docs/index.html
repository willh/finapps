<h2 id="building-your-app">Building Your App</h2>

<p>The Twilio Client iOS library works with iOS 4.2 and higher.  Making use
of the library in your Xcode project requires the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add the <code>${TWILIO_CLIENT_HOME}/libTwilioClient.a</code> static library to
your project.</li>
  <li>Add the <code>${TWILIO_CLIENT_HOME}/Headers</code> folder to &ldquo;Header Search
Paths&rdquo; in your target&rsquo;s Build Settings.</li>
  <li>Add the following iOS SDK frameworks to your project:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AudioToolbox.framework</strong> </li>
      <li><strong>AVFoundation.framework</strong> </li>
      <li><strong>CFNetwork.framework</strong> </li>
      <li><strong>SystemConfiguration.framework</strong>   </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add <code>-ObjC -all_load</code> to &ldquo;Other Linker Flags&rdquo; in your target&rsquo;s
Build Settings.</li>
  <li>Configure the &ldquo;audio&rdquo; and &ldquo;voip&rdquo; background flags for your
application.  See the <a href="#backgrounding">Backgrounding</a>  section for
more information.</li>
  <li>(Optional) If you are using the sound resources provided by the
Twilio Client library, add the contents of
<code>${TWILIO_CLIENT_HOME}/Resources/</code> to the Resources of your project.</li>
</ol>

<p>Twilio Client iOS statically links in
<a href="https://openssl.org/">openssl</a> version 1.0.0g for certain encryption
code, so if your application also uses this library, you&rsquo;ll only need
to pull the headers into your project and remove the openssl library
dependency from your project.</p>

<p>For convenience, the libTwilioClient.a library is a universal binary
containing code for the following processor architectures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>i386 (for the iOS Simulator)</li>
  <li>armv6</li>
  <li>armv7  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>The Capability Token that you provide and your Twilio Account&rsquo;s Auth
Token are two pieces of information that should <strong>not</strong>  be embedded
into your iOS application when sent to the App Store.  These tokens
allow access to your account and application by anyone, so you should
keep these secret and manage access to them very carefully.</p>

<p>The server that hands out Capability Tokens should be set up so you can
control and monitor the access to the tokens, establish firewalls, set
up blacklists/whitelists, and follow other established security best-
practices.  We recommend using a secure protocol such as HTTPS.</p>

<h2 id="threads">Threads</h2>

<p>Much of the work in the Twilio Client iOS SDK is performed in background
threads.  This includes callbacks to Twilio Client delegate objects.
You should ensure that you are on the main thread when performing any UI
updates in response to a Twilio Client delegate callback.</p>

<p>For example, if one of your objects implements the <code>TCConnectionDelegate</code>
protocol and you have a view which should update in response to the
<code>-(void)connectionDidDisconnect:(TCConnection*)connection</code> method, you
should write code similar to the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
-(void)connectionDidDisconnect:(TCConnection*)connection  
{
    // add code to update necessary model objects or other state  
    // ...  

    // finally, update the view's UI, being sure to do so on the main thread  
    [myView performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(syncUI:)  
                             withObject:param  
                          waitUntilDone:NO];  
}
</pre>

<h2 id="api-calls-on-main-and-non-main-threads">API Calls on Main and Non-Main Threads</h2>

<p>The internal architecture of Twilio Client for iOS makes use of an
asychronous queuing system to route the heavy lifting of API calls onto
a background thread managed by the library.  This helps ensure that API
calls made from the main thread will not cause UI stuttering, and it
also allows you to invoke the Twilio Client API from any thread in your
application.</p>

<h2 id="a-namebackgroundingbackgroundinga"><a name="backgrounding">Backgrounding</a></h2>

<p>You will want to ensure that the proper iOS flags (<code>audio</code>, <code>voip</code>) are
set for your application plist key &ldquo;UIBackgroundModes&rdquo; if your
application supports backgrounding.  Notice the <code>HelloMonkey-Info.plist</code>
file has the following entries in the Quick Starts projects:</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;key&gt;UIBackgroundModes&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;audio&lt;/string&gt;  
    &lt;string&gt;voip&lt;/string&gt;  
&lt;/array&gt;
</pre>

<p>In Xcode 4 you can set this in your application target by navigating to
the &ldquo;Info&rdquo; pane, and under &ldquo;Custom iOS Target Properties&rdquo; add a key for
&ldquo;Required background modes&rdquo; with the values &ldquo;App provides Voice over IP
services&rdquo; and &ldquo;App plays audio&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You also need to add
<code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents]</code>
to your application code.  Without this, the audio subsystem may fail
to restart properly when your app has been brought to the foreground.</p>

<p>For more information on backgrounding apps, including how to present
notifications for incoming calls when your app is in the background, see
&ldquo;Scheduling Local Notifications&rdquo; in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction/Introduction.html">Local and Push Notification
Programming Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sounds">Sounds</h2>

<p>Twilio Client comes with optional audio files for various connection
events including an outgoing connection sound, an incoming connection
sound, a disconnected sound, and tones for the
<code>-[TCConnection sendDigits:(NSString*)digits]</code> API.</p>

<p>If these resources are included in your project (see the <strong>Building Your
App</strong>  section), they will be automatically invoked by the Twilio Client
library at the appropriate times during a connection&rsquo;s life-cycle unless
you have overridden the relevant sound property on <code>TCDevice</code>.</p>

<p>If no other connections are pending or in-progress, the incoming
connection sound will be played in a loop through the device&rsquo;s primary
speaker as long as the Core Audio route description for output is either
the speaker or receiver (the built-in speaker you hold to your ear when
you make a call; not all iOS devices have a receiver), otherwise the
sound will be played through the current output audio route (e.g.
heaphones, Bluetooth accessory, etc.).</p>

<p>Once a connection is in-progress, the first of any additional incoming
connections will trigger the sound once through the current output audio
route.</p>

<p>All other sounds will be played through the current output audio route.</p>

<p>For more information about audio routes, see the
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/Audio/Conceptual/AudioSessionProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html">Audio Session Programming Guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you need more advanced control over playback of sounds, you may
provide audio resources with alternate names (and/or disable the sounds
using the relevant properties on TCDevice) and manage playback using
your own classes.</p>
